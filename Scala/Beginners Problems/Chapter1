# Exercises
1. Although println() is a good way to print a string, can you find a way to print a string without println? Also, what kinds of numbers, strings, and other data does the REPL support?
2. In the Scala REPL, convert the temperature value of 22.5 Centigrade to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is cToF(x) = (x * 9/5) + 32.
3. Take the result from exercise 2, halve it, and convert it back to Centigrade. You can use the generated constant variable (e.g., “res0”) instead of copying and pasting the value yourself.
